## Dominion

Dominion is an [Entity Component System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) library for Java

Dominion is:
- **fast**: not only is it an insanely fast ECS in the Java scenario, but it can also **compete with ECS solutions for C/C++** (see benchmarks)
- **tiny**: just a high-performance Core Java library with a minimal footprint and no other dependencies
- **easy**: exposes a clean, self-explanatory API, and just this readme will be enough to provide a complete usage documentation
- **wip**: this project started small and fast; the API is not yet complete and has not been fully implemented, but each crafted part already comes with unit tests and benchmarks
