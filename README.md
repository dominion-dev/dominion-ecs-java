Dominion is an [Entity Component System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) library for Java.

Entity Component System (ECS) architecture promotes data-oriented programming. It‚Äôs all about data (components) and
first-class functions (systems) that operate on data.

This means that, unlike OOP, data and operations are not encapsulated together in objects, which are called entities in
ECS.

Entities model the business objects of the user application, and the entity promotes "composition over inheritance" by
grouping a dynamic list of components to define its specific features.

Systems usually operate on components sequentially and can be very fast if data are stored in cache-friendly ways.
Systems are decoupled from each other and each system knows only about the data it operates on. This strongly promotes
high concurrency, running systems in parallel whenever they can independently operate on the data.

ECS architecture is particularly suitable (but not limited to) if you have to manage many objects in your application.
In addition, application code tends to be more reusable and easier to extend with new functionality thanks to the
components' composition and subsequent addition of new systems.

## Dominion Features

- üöÄ **_FAST_** > Dominion is not only an insanely fast ECS implemented in Java, it can also be in the same league as
  ECS for C, C++, and Rust -
  see [benchmarks](https://github.com/dominion-dev/dominion-ecs-java/tree/main/dominion-ecs-engine-benchmarks/README.md)
  .
- ü§è **_TINY_** > Just a high-performance and high-concurrency Java library with a minimal footprint and **no
  dependencies**. So you can easily integrate the Dominion core library into your game engine or framework or use it
  directly for your game or application without warring about the _dependency hell_.
- ‚òïÔ∏è **_SIMPLE_** > Dominion promotes a clean, minimal and self-explanatory API that is simple by design. A few readme
  pages will provide complete usage documentation.
- üí™ _with **SUPPORT**_ > [Join the Discord!](https://discord.gg/BHMz3axqUG) The server will support users and announce
  the availability of the new version.

## Quick Start

In your local environment you must have already installed a Java 17 (or newer) and Maven.

Add the following dependency declaration in your project pom.xml:

```xml

<project>
    <!-- ... -->

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>dev.dominion.ecs</groupId>
            <artifactId>dominion-ecs-engine</artifactId>
            <version>0.7.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>central-snapshot</id>
            <url>https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
</project>
```

[Dominion API documentation](https://github.com/dominion-dev/dominion-ecs-java/tree/main/dominion-ecs-api/README.md)
as a reference to get started implementing your first app.

## About Performance

Designing a high-performance and high-concurrency Java library is ~~a piece of cake~~ quite a challenge as the execution
speed of Java code could be affected in many ways. Dominion mitigates Java's performance pitfalls by taking a few
actions:

- **_not just using the standard library_**: the Java standard library implements data structures and algorithms
  designed without making any assumption about the data as they are general purpose. Dominion implements some custom
  data structures and algorithms to increase performances and fill the gap with ECS frameworks written in system
  languages.
- **_reducing garbage collection activities_**: GC could affect overall performances as its activities run concurrently
  with user code and without direct control. To reduce GC activities significantly, Dominion implements a very efficient
  pooling system to reuse objects living in a heap and creates off-heap data structures whenever possible.
- **_mastering concurrency_**: an ECS library must be not only fast but able to scale running on a multicore CPU.
  Otherwise, it makes little sense today. Writing a highly concurrent library in Java requires non-blocking concurrency
  as much as possible and leveraging the best available lock implementation as the
  fast [StampedLock](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/StampedLock.html).
- **_using Java 17_**: only by upgrading to the Java 17 you will get a performance boost for free: Java 17 is about 8-9%
  faster than Java 11.
- **_adding a blazing-fast logging layer_**: by implementing a thin logging layer over the
  standard [System.Logger](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/264) (Platform Logging API and Service - JEP 264), Dominion
  achieves a half nanosecond logging level check with next to no performance impact and does not require a specific
  dependency on the logging implementation of your choice.

## Ok, enough blah blah blah..

Here is an example:

```java
public class HelloDominion {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // creates your world
        Dominion hello = Dominion.create();

        // creates an entity with components
        hello.createEntity(
                "my-entity",
                new Position(0, 0),
                new Velocity(1, 1)
        );

        // creates a system
        Runnable system = () -> {
            //finds entities
            hello.findEntitiesWith(Position.class, Velocity.class)
                    // stream the results
                    .stream().forEach(result -> {
                        Position position = result.comp1();
                        Velocity velocity = result.comp2();
                        position.x += velocity.x;
                        position.y += velocity.y;
                        System.out.printf("Entity %s moved with %s to %s\n",
                                result.entity().getName(), velocity, position);
                    });
        };

        // creates a scheduler
        Scheduler scheduler = hello.createScheduler();
        // schedules the system
        scheduler.schedule(system);
        // starts 3 ticks per second
        scheduler.tickAtFixedRate(3);
    }

    // component types can be both classes and records

    static class Position {
        double x, y;

        public Position(double x, double y) {/*...*/}

        @Override
        public String toString() {/*...*/}
    }

    record Velocity(double x, double y) {
    }
}
```

## Dominion Examples Page

Dominion comes with some documented sample apps to help adopt the solution, like the **HelloDominion** sample above.

The **DarkEntities** sample app has also been added, it could inspire a turn-based rogue-like game running on a terminal
window:
