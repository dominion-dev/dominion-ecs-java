Dominion aims to keep its APIs footprint as small as possible.

This approach will lead to a smoother learning curve for users and less work for authors to keep documentation up to
date.

As per tradition, Java projects come with a standard Javadoc site to provide API documentation. Domination breaks
tradition by putting all its API documents in this README.
