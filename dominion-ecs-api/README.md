Dominion strives to have a minimal API surface to ease the learning curve for users. With a bunch of well-organized
interfaces, the library is capable of providing all the functionality implemented by the engine. This documentation will
focus on these few interfaces.

As per tradition, Java projects come with a standard Javadoc site to provide API documentation. Domination breaks
tradition by putting all API documents into this README to provide seamless navigation within the repository.
