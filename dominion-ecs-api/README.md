Dominion strives to have a minimal API surface to ease the learning curve for users.

With a bunch of well-organized interfaces, the library is capable of providing all the functionality implemented by the
engine. This documentation will focus on these few interfaces.

As per tradition, Java projects come with a standard Javadoc site for API documentation. Domination breaks tradition by
putting all API references into this README to provide seamless navigation within the repository.
